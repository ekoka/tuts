- A *graph* is a set of *vertices* and *edges* connecting some, none, or all the vertices. 

- An *undirected* graph is a graph whose edges connect their vertices in both directions.

- A *path* is a sequence of intermediary edges connecting one origin vertice to a destination vertice. 

- A *connected* undirected graph is one where there's a path connecting all its vertices to each other.

- An *acyclic* undirected and connected graph forms a tree.
